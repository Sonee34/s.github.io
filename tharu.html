<h5>Materials and methods</h5>
 <p>Materials and methods
    The present study was conducted among a small village of Tharu tribal community of Sirtaganj Block, Uttarakhand. 
    Human health and status profile depend on different physiological parameters but not all of them are equally important and informative.
     Although some physical parameters are really helpful to find out the health profile of individuals (Height, weight, blood pressure and 
     blood parameters), but in present study we only use blood profile data. On the basis of haemoglobin (Hb) value and a complete blood count (CBC), we find important information with regarding of their diseases, nutrition, and awareness of health. In CBC, we examine about blood cells which are necessary to maintain our blood circulation system. Red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, HCT (Hematocrit) and PCV (packed cell volume) are major parameters including in CBCs for blood analysis. Nevertheless, data was also collected about their literacy, ritual social status, and physiological condition (i.e. Age, Sex etc) through the using structured Scheduled, Observation, and unstructured interview. Random blood samples were collected from 108 Tharu individuals (67Females and 41Males) following proper ethical guidelines and to taking written consents from individuals. Blood samples were stored in K2 EDTA vacutainers (6 ml) and samples were processed in Medonic M-Series cell counter for examining to different parameters of blood cell counting.

        <h6>Health status of tharu tribe in india</h6>
        <div id="health" <strong> health status of the tribal people throughout the country is very poor.</strong>
             Different studies4–6 have tried to establish this with the help of morbidity, mortality and health statistics.
              The health problem of the tribal peoples of India depends upon the socio-economic, socio-cultural and ecological factors.
              5,7 Malnutrition is common among them which affect the general physique of them. They try to prevent and protect their health
               with the help of Ojha-Guni, Jhar -fook and traditional medicine man. In an acute situation, some well established family go
                to hospital to consult the doctor and taking proper treatment. However, their attitude towards modern medical care is not encouraging.>

    <h7>Family and marriage system</h7>
    <p class="fam">Tharu marriages are monogamous, therefore the elder persons of family arrange the marriage within the group except for same exogamous ‘Gotra' unit. In past they practiced child marriage but presently marriage age is increased due to social awareness. Tharu is paternal arranged family system, nevertheless women have a good status and play important role in socio-economic structure of her society.</p>
